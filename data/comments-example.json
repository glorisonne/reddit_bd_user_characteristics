He needed to go to the psychiatric hospital twice.  Seven yrs into our marriage he was finally diagnosed. One thing I learned with mental health issues is that you can't fix it for them. Ultimately, they have to accept the problem and work to fix it. This is the first time I learned that I'm unable to fix something no matter how hard I work.",
