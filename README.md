## Requirements
python 3.8, nltk 3.5, pandas 1.2.3

## Folder structure
The data/ folder contains examples (paraphrased from real posts) for submissions and comments.
To receive the full original dataset under a Data Usage Agreement, please contact Glorianna Jagfeld (g.jagfeld@lancaster.ac.uk).

The output/ folder will contain any output files generated by the two steps below.
Additionally, it contains user_countries.csv, which provides the number of users per country of
origin as estimated via https://github.com/kharrigian/smgeo.

The disclosure-patterns/ folder contains self-reported diagnosis patterns and mental health diagnosis terms (see separate README.txt within the folder)

## Code

1. Identify self-reported diagnosis posts

  + Build patterns: For each diagnosis (CONDITION), CONDITION_inclusion-patterns.txt and CONDITION_exclusion-patterns.txt are saved to /disclosure-patterns/expanded-diagnosis-patterns/
  
  + Apply patterns: Prints post.id \t post.user_name to one file for each diagnosis and input file to the output/ folder

2. Extract self-reported age and gender

Extracts self-reported age and gender from submission titles, writes results to output/users_age_gender.csv

Run all steps on example data (demonstrates code usage):
python run_example.py
