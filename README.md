## Requirements
python 3.8, nltk 3.5, pandas 1.2.3

## Data
The data/ folder contains examples (paraphrased from real posts) for submissions and comments.
You can request the actual data [here](https://doi.org/10.17635/lancaster/researchdata/589) upon providing the filled in [data usage agreement](https://github.com/glorisonne/reddit_bd_mood_posting_mh/blob/02a72b2ae1810503de145f5e77bdff76bb8ab13e/data/DataUsageAgreement_SBiDDDataset.docx).
Access to the data will only be granted for non-commercial research purposes.
To reproduce the results of this study, you require the files posts_meta.csv, posts_texts.csv, and users.csv.

The output/ folder will contain any output files generated by the two steps below.
Additionally, it contains user_countries.csv, which provides the number of users per country of
origin as estimated via [Keith Harrigian's Reddit geolocation inference model](https://github.com/kharrigian/smgeo).

The disclosure-patterns/ folder contains self-reported diagnosis patterns and mental health diagnosis terms
(see separate README.txt within the folder).

## Code

1. Identify self-reported diagnosis posts

  + Build patterns: For each diagnosis (CONDITION), CONDITION_inclusion-patterns.txt and CONDITION_exclusion-patterns.txt are saved to /disclosure-patterns/expanded-diagnosis-patterns/
  
  + Apply patterns: Prints post.id \t post.user_name to one file for each diagnosis and input file to the output/ folder

2. Extract self-reported age and gender

Extracts self-reported age and gender from submission titles, writes results to output/users_age_gender.csv

Run all steps on example data (demonstrates code usage):
python run_example.py
