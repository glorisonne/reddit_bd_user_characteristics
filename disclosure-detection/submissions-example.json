I was sure he had bipolar but he didn't want to get a diagnosis. Then we remembered that years ago he was diagnosed with hypothyroidism but got treated and then fogot about it. Now he got his bloodwork tested again and the doctor said it's likely back. Do you know if hypothyroidism can cause wild mood swings as well?",

Short story: I'm 30F, diagnosed as bipolar T2 almost three years ago. Since then I've struggled so hard because I lost so many things. Recently, it's been especially hard and I found myself smoking again, which I've done before to self-medicate hyponaia. I just hope I can finish the bud tonight and start again tomorrow anew.",

Following this, I was briefly diagnosed as psychotic manic, schizophrenic, and bipolar type 1. Recently I talked to someone who also had been through a lot and insisted that medications are not necessary to stay well. I think I felt better pre-medication but I'm worried stopping with my medication will get me to hospital again. I don't know, that's just what I've been thinking about lately",
